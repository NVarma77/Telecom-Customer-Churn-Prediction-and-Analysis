# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis
Developed a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict customer churn in the telecom industry, optimizing features and achieving 78% accuracy for business insights
 # Telecom Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company using a logistic regression model. The model analyzes customer data, such as services and payment history, to identify key factors leading to churn.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Merging, cleaning, and feature engineering.
- **Feature Selection:** Implemented Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to optimize model performance.
- **Model Accuracy:** Achieved 78% accuracy using logistic regression.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC analysis for performance optimization.

## Model Details
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification of customer churn.
- **Feature Selection**: Applied RFE and VIF analysis to reduce multicollinearity.
- **Performance Metrics**: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and accuracy scores for model evaluation.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 78%
- **Sensitivity**: 77.6%
- **Specificity**: 76.7%

## Tools and Libraries
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `statsmodels`
- `matplotlib`

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate additional machine learning models, such as Random Forest or XGBoost.
- Explore deeper customer segmentation through advanced clustering techniques.
